# For running WITHOUT Docker (backend and frontend each have their own .env):
#   cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
#   cp frontend/.env.example frontend/.env
#
# For running WITH Docker Compose (one .env at project root):
#   Copy this file to .env and set at least DEEPGRAM_API_KEY.
#   Then: docker compose up --build

# Required for Docker: Deepgram API key (live transcription)
DEEPGRAM_API_KEY=your_deepgram_api_key_here

# Optional: override defaults for the backend container
# SECRET_KEY=dev-secret-change-in-production
# JWT_SECRET=
